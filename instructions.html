<h1>Frontend Developer Programming Exercise</h1>

<p>
Your task is to create a simple user interface that allows a user to login and perform
simple search operations. This is to be done with Javascript, HTML and CSS, using any libraries, 
frameworks, or tools you prefer (so long as they are also Javascript-, HTML- or CSS-based).
This is expected to be around 3-4 hours worth of work. Be prepared to discuss your solution and
the reasoning behind your approach after you are finished.
</p>

<p>
Add code to this folder (/test) to perform your programming exercise.
</p>

<h2>Backend Details</h2>

<p>
This is the endpoint you will be invoking as part of this test: <strong>http://localhost:8080/rest2ldap/users</strong>
</p>

<p>
This is a REST-based URL that returns JSON. It is designed to allow you to easily make 
requests for user data using AJAX. The actual user data is stored in a publicly-
accessible LDAP server; this endpoint has been preconfigured to work with that server.
You are not expected to have or need any knowledge of LDAP or server configuration for this test.
</p>

<p>
Requests to this endpoint must be made with AJAX or another REST client. You cannot simply open it 
with your browser, because it expects authentication headers to be present as part of the request. 
You can login with the <strong>X-Username: user.0</strong> and <strong>X-Password: password</strong>. 
It is expected that the user will provide these values as part of the login process for the application
you are building.
</p>

<p>

To make requests on this endpoint, you will need to provide authentication headers like so:

<blockquote><pre>
GET http://localhost:8080/rest2ldap/users/user.0 HTTP/1.0
X-Username:user.0
X-Password:password
</pre></blockquote>

This will return data like so:

<blockquote><pre>{
    "_rev": "000000004600b1fa",
    "schemas": [
        "urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"
    ],
    "contactInformation": {
        "telephoneNumber": "+1 685 622 6202",
        "emailAddress": "user.0@maildomain.net"
    },
    "_id": "user.0",
    "name": {
        "familyName": "Amar",
        "givenName": "Aaccf"
    },
    "userName": "user.0@maildomain.net",
    "displayName": "Aaccf Amar"
}</pre></blockquote>

In addition to making a request for a specific user (as above), you can also perform search requests (shown unencoded for convenience):

<blockquote><pre>
GET http://localhost:8080/rest2ldap/users?_queryFilter=name/givenName sw "Amab" and displayName co "Ant" HTTP/1.0
X-Username:user.0
X-Password:password
</pre></blockquote>

This will return data like so:

<blockquote><pre>{
    "result": [
        {
            "_rev": "00000000e72bb5f3",
            "schemas": [
                "urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"
            ],
            "contactInformation": {
                "telephoneNumber": "+1 397 180 7818",
                "emailAddress": "user.289@maildomain.net"
            },
            "_id": "user.289",
            "name": {
                "familyName": "Antle",
                "givenName": "Amabel"
            },
            "userName": "user.289@maildomain.net",
            "displayName": "Amabel Antle"
        },
        {
            "_rev": "000000004c45b66d",
            "schemas": [
                "urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"
            ],
            "contactInformation": {
                "telephoneNumber": "+1 331 181 4377",
                "emailAddress": "user.290@maildomain.net"
            },
            "_id": "user.290",
            "name": {
                "familyName": "Antoft",
                "givenName": "Amabelle"
            },
            "userName": "user.290@maildomain.net",
            "displayName": "Amabelle Antoft"
        }
    ],
    "resultCount": 2,
    "pagedResultsCookie": null,
    "remainingPagedResults": -1
}</pre></blockquote>

You can have complex values for _queryFilter, but the main point to userstand is that you can refer to top-level fields (such as "userName") by their name, and you refer to nested properties with a path separator like so: "name/givenName" and "contactInformation/emailAddress". There are several operators allowed, the most important being these: sw means "Starts With"; co means "Contains"; eq means "Equals". As can be seen from the example, you can combine statements with "and"/"or".
